# DynATOS Queries

Scripts used for generating query workloads for evaluation of [DynATOS](https://onrg.gitlab.io/projects/dynatos/).

Referenced from "Dynamic Scheduling of Approximate Telemetry Queries" (NSDI '22).

# Contents

- `gen_query_workload.py`: A python script for generating dynamic query workload specifications. Each specification is a (timed) sequence of "base" queries and a required number of "followup" queries for each base query.

- `query_workload_driver.c`: A C program for running a dynamic query workload specification. Interfaces with the `switch module` (not included here) to execute base and followup queries. Writes query results and metadata from the switch module.

- `example_workloads/`: A directory with example workloads generated by `gen_query_workload.py`.

- `example_metadata/`: A directory with example metadata as read from the `switch module` and output by `query_workload_driver.c`.
